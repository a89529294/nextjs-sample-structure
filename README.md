# A Sample Project Structure

1. create a `src/` folder right inside of root
2. Move `pages/` and `styles/` into `src/`
3. Create `components/`, `utilities/`, and `lib` in `src/`
4. `lib/` should be code that explicitly wrap third part libs, for example `react-query`
5. We can put any vendor js or css files into `public` then import them directly in our code.
